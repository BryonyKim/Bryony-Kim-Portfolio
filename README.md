Bryony Kim Portfolio
 
A simple portfolio website showing a number of example projects to demonstrate my skills in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PHP, MySQL, WordPress, React and Node.
Each folder contains a project, ranging from a maths game, made using JavaScript, to note making and editing, made using PHP.
