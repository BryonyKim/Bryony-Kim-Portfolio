# Bryony Kim Portfolio
 
A simple portfolio website showing a number of example projects to demonstrate my skills in HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Bootstrap, PHP and MySQL.
Each folder contains a project, ranging from a maths game, made using JavaScript, to note making and editing, made using PHP.
